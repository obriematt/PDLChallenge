Steps for Data ETL:
1. Navigate to the project directory.
2. Run python datafilter.py 

*Note: This script makes the assumption that the bootstrap server is localhost:9092 and the raw data topic is raw_data. It will write only to filtered_data, and only filter on the year 2014.*

The code for this is located within spark_streaming_etl.txt.
